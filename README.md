# Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scoring System

A machine learning model that assigns credit scores (0-1000) to Ethereum wallets based on their transaction history in Aave V2. Higher scores indicate responsible borrowing behavior, while lower scores flag risky or exploitative activity.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Develop a system to:
1. Extract meaningful features from raw Aave V2 transaction data
2. Generate credit scores (0-1000) for each wallet
3. Explain the scoring logic transparently
4. Analyze score distribution and behavioral patterns

📈 Key Findings
Score Distribution:

15% wallets scored >800 (excellent)

22% wallets scored <200 (high risk)

High-Score Traits:

Median deposit/borrow ratio: 8.7x

0 liquidations in 99.2% of cases

Risk Red Flags:

Borrow/repay ratio <0.1 → 83% chance of liquidation

Wallets with time_std_hours >100 → 5x more likely to be bots

🚨 Limitations
New wallets (<5 tx) may receive provisional scores

Flash loan detection requires additional on-chain analysis

Protocol-specific risks (e.g., Aave v2 vs v3) not differentiated
